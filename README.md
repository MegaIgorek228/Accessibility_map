This is a website that is an interactive map with markers that, when clicked, display a photo of the object and a description of its accessibility. The placemarks have different colors, which correspond to the accessibility category of the object. There is also a menu on the site that opens using the button in the upper-left corner. In the menu, you can change the theme, change the font, sort labels by accessibility categories, learn more about these categories, and you can also open the add markers window, which allows you to create and publish a new label yourself.
